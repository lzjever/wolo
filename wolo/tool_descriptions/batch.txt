Execute multiple tool calls in parallel for better performance.

Usage:
- Provide an array of tool calls to execute simultaneously
- Each tool call specifies the tool name and its arguments
- Results are returned in the same order as the input

When to use:
- When you need to perform multiple independent operations
- When operations don't depend on each other's results
- To speed up tasks like reading multiple files or running multiple searches

When NOT to use:
- When operations depend on each other (use sequential calls instead)
- When you need to process results before the next operation
- For single operations (just call the tool directly)

Examples:
- Read multiple files at once
- Search for multiple patterns in parallel
- Run multiple independent shell commands
