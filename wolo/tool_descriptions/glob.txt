Find files matching a glob pattern.

Features:
- Fast file search that works with any codebase size
- Supports standard glob patterns (*, **, ?, [])
- Returns file paths sorted by modification time (most recent first)

Usage:
- Use this tool when you need to find files by name or path pattern
- The pattern parameter accepts glob patterns like "**/*.py", "src/**/*.ts"
- The path parameter specifies the base directory to search from

Common patterns:
- "**/*.py" - Find all Python files recursively
- "*.txt" - Find all .txt files in current directory
- "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}" - Find all TypeScript files in src directory
- "**/test_*.py" - Find all test files
- "**/__init__.py" - Find all Python package init files

When to use Glob vs other tools:
- Use Glob for finding files by name/path pattern
- Use Grep for searching file contents
- Use shell with `find` only for complex queries that glob can't handle

Best practices:
- Start with broader patterns and narrow down if needed
- Use ** for recursive searches
- Combine with Read to examine found files
