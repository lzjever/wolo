Apply multiple edits to files in a single operation. Each edit specifies a file, old text, and new text.

Usage:
- You MUST use the Read tool to read files before editing them.
- Each edit follows the same rules as the single Edit tool.
- Edits are applied in order, so later edits can depend on earlier ones.
- If any edit fails, the operation stops and reports the error.

When to use:
- When you need to make multiple related changes across one or more files
- When changes are interdependent and should be applied together
- For refactoring operations that touch multiple locations

Best practices:
- Group related edits together
- Order edits logically (e.g., imports before usage)
- Include enough context in each old_text to uniquely identify the location
