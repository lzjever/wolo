Save important knowledge or skills to long-term memory for future sessions.

Use this tool when the user asks you to remember something, or when you encounter important knowledge that should be preserved across sessions.

The tool will analyze the current conversation context and generate a structured memory entry with title, summary, tags, and detailed content.

Memories are stored globally at ~/.wolo/memories/ and can be recalled in any future session using memory_recall.
