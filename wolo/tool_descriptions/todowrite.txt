Update the todo list for tracking task progress.

Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current session. This helps track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness.

When to use:
- Complex multi-step tasks (3+ distinct steps)
- Non-trivial tasks requiring careful planning
- User explicitly requests todo list
- User provides multiple tasks (numbered/comma-separated)
- After receiving new instructions - capture requirements as todos
- After completing tasks - mark complete and add follow-ups
- When starting new tasks - mark as in_progress

When NOT to use:
- Single, straightforward tasks
- Trivial tasks with no organizational benefit
- Tasks completable in < 3 trivial steps
- Purely conversational/informational requests

Task states:
- pending: Not yet started
- in_progress: Currently working on (only ONE at a time)
- completed: Finished successfully

Best practices:
- Create specific, actionable items
- Break complex tasks into manageable steps
- Update status in real-time
- Mark complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing
- Only ONE task in_progress at a time
- Complete current tasks before starting new ones
