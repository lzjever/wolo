Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You MUST use the Read tool at least once before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears in the file. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + pipe. Everything after that pipe is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_text or new_text.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- The edit will FAIL if `old_text` is not found in the file.
- The edit will FAIL if `old_text` is found multiple times in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique.
- Only replaces the first occurrence of old_text.

Best practices:
- Include enough context in old_text to uniquely identify the location (at least 3-5 lines before and after the change point)
- Preserve exact whitespace and indentation
- Make small, focused edits rather than large replacements
- After editing, consider reading the file again to verify the change was applied correctly
