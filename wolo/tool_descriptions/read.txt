Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- The file_path parameter should be an absolute path or relative to the current working directory
- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned with line numbers starting at 1
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a warning.
- You can read image files using this tool.

When to use:
- Before editing any file, you MUST read it first to understand its current contents
- When exploring a codebase to understand its structure
- When you need to verify the contents of a file after making changes
