Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size.

Features:
- Searches file contents using regular expressions
- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., "log.*Error", "function\s+\w+", "class\s+\w+")
- Filter files by pattern with the include_pattern parameter (e.g., "*.py", "*.{ts,tsx}")
- Returns file paths and line numbers with matching content
- Results are sorted by modification time (most recent first)

Usage:
- Use this tool when you need to find files containing specific patterns
- The pattern parameter accepts regular expressions
- The path parameter specifies where to search (default: current directory)
- The include_pattern parameter filters which files to search

When to use Grep vs other tools:
- Use Grep for searching file contents
- Use Glob for finding files by name/path pattern
- Use shell with `rg` directly if you need advanced ripgrep features or match counts
- When doing an open-ended search that may require multiple rounds of searching, consider using the Task tool to delegate

Examples:
- Find all TODO comments: pattern="TODO|FIXME"
- Find function definitions: pattern="def \w+\("
- Find class definitions in Python files: pattern="class \w+", include_pattern="*.py"
