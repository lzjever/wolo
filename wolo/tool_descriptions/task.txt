Delegate a task to a specialized sub-agent for parallel or focused work.

Usage:
- Use this tool to spawn a sub-agent that can work on a specific task independently
- The sub-agent has access to the same tools as the main agent
- Results are returned when the sub-agent completes its task

Agent types:
- general: General-purpose agent for most tasks
- plan: Planning agent for designing implementation approaches (read-only, cannot modify files)
- explore: Exploration agent for researching and understanding code (read-only)

When to use:
- When you need to perform multiple independent tasks in parallel
- When a task requires focused attention without context switching
- When exploring a large codebase where different areas can be examined independently
- When the task is well-defined and can be completed without further user input

Best practices:
- Provide clear, specific goals for the sub-agent
- Use for tasks that are independent and don't require coordination
- Don't use for tasks that need user confirmation or interaction
- Consider using plan agent for complex tasks that need design first
