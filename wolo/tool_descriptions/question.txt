Ask the user one or more questions to gather information needed to complete a task.

Use this tool when you need clarification or additional information from the user that cannot be determined from the codebase or context.

Usage:
- Provide one or more questions in the questions array
- Each question can optionally include suggested options for the user to choose from
- The user's answers will be returned in the same order as the questions

When to use:
- When requirements are ambiguous and you need clarification
- When there are multiple valid approaches and user preference matters
- When you need specific information (e.g., API keys, configuration values)
- When the task involves subjective decisions

When NOT to use:
- When the answer can be found in the codebase
- When you can make a reasonable default choice
- For trivial decisions that don't significantly impact the outcome

Best practices:
- Ask specific, focused questions
- Provide helpful options when applicable
- Group related questions together
- Explain why you need the information if not obvious
